To run ionic into android device

ionic cordova run android


Ionic can automatically generate perfectly sized icons and splash screens from source images (.png, .psd, or .ai) for your Cordova platforms.

The source image for icons should ideally be at least 1024×1024px and located at resources/icon.png. The source image for splash screens should ideally be at least 2732×2732px and located at resources/splash.png. If you used ionic start, there should already be default Ionic resources in the resources/ directory, which you can overwrite.

You can also generate platform-specific icons and splash screens by placing them in the respective resources// directory. For example, to generate an icon for Android, place your image at resources/android/icon.png.
